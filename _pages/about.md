Hello! I am Shruti. 

I am first year Computer Science Ph.D. student at [IIT Gandhinagar](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/) and I am advised by [Prof. Mayank Singh](https://mayank4490.github.io/). My research interest lies in the field of Natural Language Processing. Specifically, I am interested in information extraction from scientific literature and common sense reasoning. My research goal is to develop tools that assist researchers at various stages of the research cycle and expedite the process of knowledge discovery.

Earlier, I was a Research Engineer at [Raxter](https://raxter.io), which is an AI powered research workflow assistant platform. Prior to this, I was a Product Engineer at [Sprinklr Inc](https://www.sprinklr.com/).

I completed my Bachelors (Hons.) in Information and Communication Technology with a minor in Computational Science from [DA-IICT](https://www.daiict.ac.in/).

<!-- It's a magical world, Hobbes, ol' buddy. Let's go exploring! -->

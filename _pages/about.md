singh_shruti AT iitgn DOT ac DOT in

I am a doctoral student in the Computer Science & Engineering discipline at <a href="https://www.iitgn.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IIT Gandhinagar</a>, where I am advised by <a href="https://mayank4490.github.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Mayank Singh</a>.  

My research is supported by Prime Minister's Research Fellowship (<a href="https://www.pmrf.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PMRF</a>) and <a href="https://www.usief.org.in/index.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fulbright-Nehru Doctoral Research Fellowship</a>. I am currently a visiting Fulbright-Nehru Scholar at Yale University, where I am grateful to be advised by <a href="https://armancohan.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Arman Cohan</a>.  

My research interests lie in the field of Natural Language Processing, Information Retrieval, and Social Networks. Specifically, I am interested in learning representations of long documents (specifically scientific articles). My research goal is to develop tools that assist researchers at various stages of the research cycle and expedite the process of knowledge discovery, and to democratize the entry of marginalized communities into research. Recently, I have also started exploring Psycholinguistics. I am interested in understanding how humans acquire and understand language.

Earlier, I was a Research Engineer at <a href="https://raxter.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Raxter</a>, which is an AI powered research workflow assistant platform. Prior to this, I was a Product Engineer at <a href="https://www.sprinklr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sprinklr Inc</a>.

I completed my Bachelors (Hons.) in Information and Communication Technology with a minor in Computational Science from <a href="https://www.daiict.ac.in/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DA-IICT</a>.

Hello! I am Shruti. 

I currently work as a Research Engineer at [Raxter](https://raxter.io), which is a tool to boost research productivity. 

I completed my Bachelors (Hons.) in Information and Communication Technology with a minor in Computational Science from [DA-IICT](https://www.daiict.ac.in/).

Hello! I am Shruti. 

I am first year Computer Science Ph.D. student at [IIT Gandhinagar](https://www.iitgn.ac.in/). My research interest lies in the field of Natural Language Processing. Specifically, I am interested in Information Extraction from scientific literature and Common sense reasoning.

Earlier, I was a Research Engineer at [Raxter](https://raxter.io), which is an AI powered research workflow assistant platform. Prior to this, I was a Product Engineer at [Sprinklr Inc](https://www.sprinklr.com/).

I completed my Bachelors (Hons.) in Information and Communication Technology with a minor in Computational Science from [DA-IICT](https://www.daiict.ac.in/).

<!-- It's a magical world, Hobbes, ol' buddy. Let's go exploring! -->
